# Palmer Penguins
Measurements for penguin species, island in **Palmer Archipelago**, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.
## Call Libraries
```{r Libraries, message=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Describe the Data

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Scatter Plot
Start with the penguins data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis. Represent each observation with a point and map species to the colour of each point. Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source. Finally, use a discrete colour scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness.
```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
                     y = bill_length_mm,
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill depth and length",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
       colour = "Species",
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```
## Scatter Plot Enchanced
```{r}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
           y = bill_length_mm,
           colour = species,
           shape = species,
           size = body_mass_g,
           alpha = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d()
```

## Scatter Plot with Facet Grid
```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species ~ island)
```
